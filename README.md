# Grid Shader

A Grid Shader for Unity !    
It can scale infinitely (log10 scaling). Main lines will show a one to one grid for the current scale, while secondary lines show up secondary units.       
It performs much better than relying on GL lines to draw a grid, has more customization possibilities and works in a lot more situations.
